# VGHS, Hazrat Shahjalal Intl Airport, Dhaka - Custom Scenery for FlightGear

This is the latest(2025) custom scenery of the VGHS, Dhaka airport for FlightGear. 


This includes only the airport scenery(aprons, runways, taxiways etc.) & doesn't contain the surrounding graphic tiles beyond the airport layout boundary. Which will place the airport on an open ocean if you do not have the terrasync scenery tiles for that area. So it will look something like the following:

![VGHS layout without scenery tiles](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1297225320398852117/1362811877800935565/image.png?ex=6803c0f7&is=68026f77&hm=b5a920874fc51b41cdccf1690324c5d528bd66178496887a23e6fdef9efd4af0&)

Currently the project is under development, so to make things easier, first Download the VGZR airport(former ICAO identifier of VGHS) from FG just like any other airport. Then just add this scenery as a scenery addon to have the latest layout.
I'll try my best to update the scenery with much more buildings, hangars, graveyeard and stuff.

### Thanks to:
- X-Plane: The main layout(apt.dat) is basically taken from the X-Plane's scenery gateway and been edited a littel in WorldEditor by me to a proper scenery generation format. Also the WorldEditor is from X-Plane if you know!
- The entire FlightGear community: Terrasync docker container, specifically the `genapts850` tool has been used for the scenery generation. FlightGear's discord server has been really helpful for me to understand basic development things. Also their forum and wiki have been a great way to learn those things. Cheers to the entire community!
